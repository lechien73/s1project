            <td><p>I have been a loyal customer of one of your main competitors for my entire life. However, I recently walked into you Noosa shop and was served by [name removed] who gave me faultless service and explained the advantages of your double doby board shorts after I explained my disappointment with my existing stretch boardies from your competitor. Since purchasing and loving them I have been back and bought a second pair. I also mentioned to [name removed] about the sex wax dream cream and how good it was. He took my number and called me one week l ater to tell me he had requested to get some in store and has put some away for me. This service and quality product is the difference between you and your competitors and has won me over. Consider me a quiksilver loyal customer from now on.Thank you.</p></td>
